In order to Deploy app in CH 2.0, We first need to publish the Project into Anypoint Exchange to do that we have to use mvn deploy command in cmd of inside that project directory where pom.xml is located

After Project gets published into Anypoint Exchange we need to fire another command mvn deploy -DmuleDeploy  in cmd of inside that project directory where pom.xml is located to deploy an app in Runtime Manager.

If its a new app that never got published into exchange n we directly tried mvn deploy -DmuleDeploy command, Deployment to Runtime Manager fails with "There is no asset with matching parameter."

-snapshot versions (1.0.0-SNAPSHOT) gets deployed in Development mode permanently
